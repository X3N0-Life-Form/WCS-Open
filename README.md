WCS-Open
========

(codename: bearded-batman)

Based on MatthTheGeek's WCSOpen project, which predates Wing Commander Saga's source code release.
This project's aim is to enable Wing Commander Saga to run on regular Freespace Open builds, while keeping the game's feel and gameplay experience as close as possible to the original release.

Note that as of september 2014, this mod requires special FSO builds that include features backported from WCS to FSO, but haven't been submitted the FS Source Code Project (yet).
